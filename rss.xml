            <title><![CDATA[Review for the Joint]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Review for the Joint</h1><p>Go here! Dr. Bryan is a bone-cracking artist. I've been to many chiropractors throughout my life. None of them know how to do an upper back combo adjustment like this man. He is thorough; I consistently walk out of here completely in alignment. Contrast this to other chiropractors who will adjust a few things and send you on your way. I've been treated consistently since February from this location, and I can tell you that my back pain is well under control. I've also corrected my posture and learned new ergonomic habits from this place. I think the best part about this is that I've only paid $59 or $69 per month (I can't remember) for 4 adjustments each month. Additional adjustments within the monthly billing cycle are only $10 extra. It's month to month. There is no minimum contract. This is top quality chiropractic care for only a fraction of the traditional cost. Go here. You won't regret it.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/5cc1cd5b-b131-4313-98e8-e9fd61bf0f5a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Review of Bonnie & Clyde’s CB Stereo]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Review of Bonnie & Clyde’s CB Stereo</h1><p>Mason (owner) and Eddie (installer) are some pretty righteous bros. My 20 year old car had issues relating to the electrical components that surfaced after installation. They worked with me to fix the issues and get my stereo working. I think they did a great job managing the process; I appreciate their responsiveness to my needs. The store is very hospitable with a fridge and recliner chairs. I would recommend this place.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/22ec74c9-8cb8-47fe-bdb9-0e6b252da347.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Review for Discount Tire Store]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Review for Discount Tire Store</h1><p>This place has great prices and great service. My experience has been that they provide a transparent sales process. When you buy your tires here, you get free air checks and free alignments. It is really a good deal. They are a big and trusted company. I used them in CA. And now I use them in TX.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6fdc58ae-e3f3-4ba0-ae21-905a4cc214cc.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Habit is tech</h1><p>In 2010, I started a company that forever impacted how I approach product marketing. The company sold data, specifically sales prospecting lists for B2B marketing technology companies. Instead of simply delivering CSV files, our data was packaged in a web app that customers could use to interact with the data.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/7fd8c1bd09ca7bdee59ab9a0eae105d6/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fi1.wp.com%2Fengeljournal.files.wordpress.com%2F2016%2F07%2F3116650631_6c365aec34_o.jpg%3Ffit%3D440%252C330%26ssl%3D1"></article>]]></description>
