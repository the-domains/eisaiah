  Mason (owner) and Eddie (installer) are some pretty righteous bros. My 20 year
  old car had issues relating to the electrical components that surfaced after
  installation. They worked with me to fix the issues and get my stereo working.
  I think they did a great job managing the process; I appreciate their
  responsiveness to my needs. The store is very hospitable with a fridge and
  recliner chairs. I would recommend this place.

# Review of Bonnie & Clyde's CB Stereo

Mason (owner) and Eddie (installer) are some pretty righteous bros. My 20 year old car had issues relating to the electrical components that surfaced after installation. They worked with me to fix the issues and get my stereo working. I think they did a great job managing the process; I appreciate their responsiveness to my needs. The store is very hospitable with a fridge and recliner chairs. I would recommend this place.
