  In 2010, I started a company that forever impacted how I approach product
  marketing. The company sold data, specifically sales prospecting lists for B2B
  marketing technology companies. Instead of simply delivering CSV files, our
  data was packaged in a web app that customers could use to interact with the
  data.
