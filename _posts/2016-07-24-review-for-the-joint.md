  Go here! Dr. Bryan is a bone-cracking artist. I've been to many chiropractors
  throughout my life. None of them know how to do an upper back combo adjustment
  like this man. He is thorough; I consistently walk out of here completely in
  alignment. Contrast this to other chiropractors who will adjust a few things
  and send you on your way. I've been treated consistently since February from
  this location, and I can tell you that my back pain is well under control.
  I've also corrected my posture and learned new ergonomic habits from this
  place. I think the best part about this is that I've only paid $59 or $69 per
  month (I can't remember) for 4 adjustments each month. Additional adjustments
  within the monthly billing cycle are only $10 extra. It's month to month.
  There is no minimum contract. This is top quality chiropractic care for only a
  fraction of the traditional cost. Go here. You won't regret it.
