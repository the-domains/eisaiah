  Wow is all that I can say. This is the type of place I'd expect to find in the
  countryside in France. The food here is off the chart, insanely good. I
  ordered the Cesar salad, and the salmon things (I am uploading a photo) I
  can't remember what they are called. They even invented their own grape
  variety here--it's a dry white wine I can't remember the exact name right now
  but it was like a Riesling. Great job all around.
